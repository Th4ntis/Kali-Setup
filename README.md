# Kali-Setup
My setup for Kali Linux
Disclaimer: I did NOT create or develop any of these tools

This is still a work in a progress as I am adding additional tools and updating the script as I got. Any constructive criticism welcome or any other tool suggestions are welcome as well. This is a script to setup a fresh install of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). This will setup some keyboard shortcuts I use, power settings, etc.

This will install: Terminator, Google Chrome, Neo4j, Bloodhound, Nessus, unzip rockyou, and pull my custom configs for tmux and terminator, as well as replace their .zshrc file with my own, grab fonts for the zsh config, and grab seclists.
