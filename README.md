# Kali Setup
Disclaimer: I did NOT create or develop any of these tools

This is still a work in a progress as I am adding additional tools and updating the script as I got. Any constructive criticism welcome or any other tool suggestions are welcome as well. This is a script to setup a fresh install of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). This will setup some keyboard shortcuts I use, power settings, etc.

`Kali-Setup.sh` - Used when Kali is installed on my Thinkpad T480(but can be used on any hardware)
`Kali-VM.sh` - Used when Kali is installed in a virtual machine.

# Changelog:
Updated for Kali 2024.2
